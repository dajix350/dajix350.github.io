title: What on earth is a Linux?

I have been asked this question so many times by my less technical friends, so I have decided to make a post I can quickly link explaining the basics.

Linux is a kernel. To put it simply, a kernel is the core of any operating system. Software running on your computer "talks" to the kernel, which then "talks" to the hardware. It manages your computers' memory, files, network, and way more.

The thing that makes Linux special is that it is open source, meaning that anyone can grab the Linux kernel code and use it for their own operating system for free. This has lead to hundreds of Linux-based operating systems (often called distros), which now power all Android phones, Chromebooks, and 96.3% of the top 1 million web servers.

It is a very versatile and stable base, which has lead to its use in everything from routers to smart cars, Hollywood production to space exploration, and every single one of the worlds 500 fastest supercomputers!
