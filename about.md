Hey! I am Dajix, an Aussie tech nerd. People also know me as Dark, Darkblade, and that annoying dude on that one discord server.

This site was founded by me in 2023, it's a blog about Linux and other open source software. The name is an acronym for Yet Another Linux Blog, since this is by no means a new concept, but I want an outlet for my accumulated knowledge and opinions from my last 3 years of learning about the Linux space.
